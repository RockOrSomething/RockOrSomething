Aloha all, this GitHub is a semi-private library for some of my personal projects.

I'm a defense professional with 2+ decades of operational experience in SOF, aviation, fire support, and strategy
...but when I grow up I want to fuse these things with machine learning, distributed manufacturing, and human-machine teaming at the edge.

I don't like the word 'drone' because it means different things to different people.

But, in a word, drones.
